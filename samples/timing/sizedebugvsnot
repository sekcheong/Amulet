Subject: results of DEBUG v. non-DEBUG measurements
Reply-to: rcm@cs.cmu.edu



Here are the results.  Conventional wisdom is borne out, for once!
Eliminating DEBUG appears to save a factor of 2, both in memory usage
and in object-creation time.  Considering these numbers, I retract my
proposal to leave -DDEBUG on all the time, and endorse Rich's
suggestion: that we have one debug library (with -g -O2 -DDEBUG) and
one release library (which might as well just be -O2).

libamulet.so (code size)	        6701 KB		       6480 KB

testselectionwidget (code size)	        1155 KB	       	       1147 KB
testselectionwidget (stack+data size)   3232 KB		       1692 KB

Initialize (time)			1498 ms			811 ms
Create objects from Root (time)	      0.2634 ms		      0.031 ms
Create objects from Am_Rect (time)    0.6752 ms		     0.4314 ms


"code size" came from ls -l.
"stack+data size" came from "ps aux" (the SZ column).
"times" came from running timing.
