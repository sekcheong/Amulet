These instructions were originally written and contributed by David
Mathog, Biology Division, Caltech.  They represent the steps he uses
to build Amulet V3 under OpenVMS.  If you are going to build the shareable
library (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!) you should also have the SYMBOLS program
installed, which you can obtain from

    ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/fileserv/SYMBOLS.ZIP

If you don't have SYMBOLS then you can use the supplied .OPT files, but any
changes that may have snuck into Amulet could break them! 

These instructions have not been tested by the Amulet group.  Report
any problems or suggestions to amulet-bugs@cs.cmu.edu.

Here are OpenVMS instructions for anybody who wants to build 3.0.  This
worked with Amulet 3.0B on OpenVMS 6.2 with DEC CXX 5.4.  This will
not work with DEC CXX 5.2 since it lacks the crucial CXXLINK utility.

1. Put MAKE_VMS.COM (or MAKE_VMS_SHARED.COM) into the [.bin] subdirectory.
   If you are making the shared version, and 
     1.  you HAVE SYMBOLS,  also put  MAKE_OPT_FROM_OLB.COM into [.bin]
     2.  you DON'T HAVE SYMBOLS, put the two *.OPT files into the [.lib]
         directory and edit MAKE_VMS_SHARED.COM so that @MAKE_OPT_FROM_OLB
         isn't executed.

   Edit the definitions of amulet, amulet_lib and amulet_dir as
   appropriate for your installation

2. Build the Amulet library, test programs and samples with:

       $ @make_vms

   or

       $ @make_vms_shared

   You should see no errors or warnings.

3. Before running any of the test programs define amulet_dir as
   appropriate for your installation, eg.

       $ define amulet_dir "/prgdisk/shared/programs/amulet/amulet"

   This logical name is needed to let amulet find it's [.lib] information.
   Obviously it is system dependent.

4. Run the test programs, either by defining foreign symbols or via RUN.
   Better have DECW$DISPLAY configured first!!!
